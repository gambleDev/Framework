Framework
=========

My very simple MVC framework

Set-Up
=========

Simply upload and youre ready to go, but keep in mind a few things:
- src/core/config/routes.php controls the app! MAKE SURE YOU UPDATE IT NOTES SHOULD HELP
- src/application contains the mvc area for your application, there are examples of uses so looks at those
- This is not finished by a long shot! This is a start for me to learn more about the structure and explore my coding experience and develop it more!
